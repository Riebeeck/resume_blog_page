and talk a lot about the risks of powerful AI. The company I=E2=80=99m the =
CEO of, Anthropic, does a lot of research on how to reduce these risks. Bec=
ause of this, people sometimes draw the conclusion that I=E2=80=99m a pessi=
mist or =E2=80=9Cdoomer=E2=80=9D who thinks AI will be mostly bad or danger=
ous. I don=E2=80=99t think that at all. In fact, one of my main reasons for=
 focusing on risks is that they=E2=80=99re the only thing standing between =
us and what I see as a fundamentally positive future. <strong>I think that =
most people are underestimating just how radical the upside of AI could be<=
/strong>, just as I think most people are underestimating how bad the risks=
 could be.</p><p>In this essay I try to sketch out what that upside might l=
ook like=E2=80=94what a world with powerful AI might look like if everythin=
g goes <em>right</em>. Of course no one can know the future with any certai=
nty or precision, and the effects of powerful AI are likely to be even more=
 unpredictable than past technological changes, so all of this is unavoidab=
ly going to consist of guesses. But I am aiming for at least educated and u=
seful guesses, which capture the flavor of what will happen even if most de=
tails end up being wrong. I=E2=80=99m including lots of details mainly beca=
use I think a concrete vision does more to advance discussion than a highly=
 hedged and abstract one.</p><p>First, however, I wanted to briefly explain=
 why I and Anthropic haven=E2=80=99t talked that much about powerful AI=E2=
=80=99s upsides, and why we=E2=80=99ll probably continue, overall, to talk =
a lot about risks. In particular, I=E2=80=99ve made this choice out of a de=
sire to:</p><ul role=3D"list"><li><strong>Maximize leverage</strong>. The b=
asic development of AI technology and many (not all) of its benefits seems =
inevitable (unless the risks derail everything) and is fundamentally driven=
 by powerful market forces. On the other hand, the risks are not predetermi=
ned and our actions can greatly change their likelihood.</li><li><strong>Av=
oid perception of propaganda</strong>. AI companies talking about all the a=
mazing benefits of AI can come off like propagandists, or as if they=E2=80=
=99re attempting to distract from downsides. I also think that as a matter =
of principle it=E2=80=99s bad for your soul to spend too much of your time =
=E2=80=9Ctalking your book=E2=80=9D.</li><li><strong>Avoid grandiosity</str=
ong>. I am often turned off by the way many AI risk public figures (not to =
mention AI company leaders) talk about the post-AGI world, as if it=E2=80=
=99s their mission to single-handedly bring it about like a prophet leading=
 their people to salvation. I think it=E2=80=99s dangerous to view companie=
s as unilaterally shaping the world, and dangerous to view practical techno=
logical goals in essentially religious terms.</li><li><strong>Avoid =E2=80=
=9Csci-fi=E2=80=9D baggage</strong>. Although I think most people underesti=
mate the upside of powerful AI, the small community of people who do discus=
s radical AI futures often does so in an excessively =E2=80=9Csci-fi=E2=80=
=9D tone (featuring e.g. uploaded minds, space exploration, or general cybe=
rpunk vibes). I think this causes people to take the claims less seriously,=
 and to imbue them with a sort of unreality. To be clear, the issue isn=E2=
=80=99t whether the technologies described are possible or likely (the main=
 essay discusses this in granular detail)=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s more that th=
e =E2=80=9Cvibe=E2=80=9D connotatively smuggles in a bunch of cultural bagg=
age and unstated assumptions about what kind of future is desirable, how va=
rious societal issues will play out, etc. The result often ends up reading =
like a fantasy for a narrow subculture, while being off-putting to most peo=
ple.</li></ul><p>Yet despite all of the concerns above, I really do think i=
t=E2=80=99s important to discuss what a good world with powerful AI could l=
ook like, while doing our best to avoid the above pitfalls. In fact I think=
 it is critical to have a genuinely inspiring vision of the future, and not=
 <em>just</em> a plan to fight fires. Many of the implications of powerful =
AI are adversarial or dangerous, but at the end of it all, there has to be =
something we=E2=80=99re fighting <em>for</em>, some positive-sum outcome wh=
ere everyone is better off, something to rally people to rise above their s=
quabbles and confront the challenges ahead. Fear is one kind of motivator, =
but it=E2=80=99s not enough: we need hope as well.</p><p>The list of positi=
ve applications of powerful AI is extremely long (and includes robotics, ma=
nufacturing, energy, and much more), but I=E2=80=99m going to focus on a sm=
all number of areas that seem to me to have the greatest potential to direc=
tly improve the quality of human life. The five categories I am most excite=
d about are:</p><ol role=3D"list"><li>Biology and physical health</li><li>N=

t it all happens and in what order.</p><p>With the above framework in mind,=
 I=E2=80=99ll try to answer that question for the five areas mentioned in t=
he introduction.</p><h2 id=3D"1-biology-and-health" class=3D"toc-heading">1=
. Biology and health</h2><p>Biology is probably the area where scientific p=
rogress has the greatest potential to directly and unambiguously improve th=
e quality of human life. In the last century some of the most ancient human=
 afflictions (such as smallpox) have finally been vanquished, but many more=
 still remain, and defeating them would be an enormous humanitarian accompl=
ishment. Beyond even curing disease, biological science can in principle im=
prove the <em>baseline</em> quality of human health, by extending the healt=
hy human lifespan, increasing control and freedom over our own biological p=
rocesses, and addressing everyday problems that we currently think of as im=
mutable parts of the human condition.</p><p>In the =E2=80=9Climiting factor=
s=E2=80=9D language of the previous section, the main challenges with direc=
tly applying intelligence to biology are data, the speed of the physical wo=
rld, and intrinsic complexity (in fact, all three are related to each other=
). Human constraints also play a role at a later stage, when clinical trial=
s are involved. Let=E2=80=99s take these one by one.</p><p>Experiments on c=
ells, animals, and even chemical processes are limited by the speed of the =
physical world: many biological protocols involve culturing bacteria or oth=
er cells, or simply waiting for chemical reactions to occur, and this can s=
ometimes take days or even weeks, with no obvious way to speed it up. Anima=
l experiments can take months (or more) and human experiments often take ye=
ars (or even decades for long-term outcome studies). Somewhat related to th=
is, data is often lacking=E2=80=94not so much in quantity, but quality: the=
re is always a dearth of clear, unambiguous data that isolates a biological=
 effect of interest from the other 10,000 confounding things that are going=
 on, or that intervenes causally in a given process, or that directly measu=
res some effect (as opposed to inferring its consequences in some indirect =
or noisy way). Even massive, quantitative molecular data, like the proteomi=
cs data that I collected while working on mass spectrometry techniques, is =
noisy and misses a lot (which types of cells were these proteins in? Which =
part of the cell? At what phase in the cell cycle?).</p><p>In part responsi=
ble for these problems with data is intrinsic complexity: if you=E2=80=99ve=
 ever seen a <a href=3D"https://today.ucsd.edu/story/international_consorti=
um_builds_google_map_of_human_metabolism" target=3D"_blank">diagram showing=
 the biochemistry of human metabolism</a>, you=E2=80=99ll know that it=E2=
=80=99s very hard to isolate the effect of any part of this complex system,=
 and even harder to intervene on the system in a precise or predictable way=
. And finally, beyond just the intrinsic time that it takes to run an exper=
iment on humans, actual clinical trials involve a lot of bureaucracy and re=
gulatory requirements that (in the opinion of many people, including me) ad=
d unnecessary additional time and delay progress.</p><p>Given all this, man=

=9D. First, these discoveries are generally made by a tiny number of resear=

. Second, they often =E2=80=9Ccould have been made=E2=80=9D years earlier t=
han they were: for example, CRISPR was a naturally occurring component of t=

ase, but keep in mind everywhere that success is not guaranteed and depends=
 on our collective efforts.</p><p>Below I make some guesses about how I thi=
nk things may go in the developing world over the 5-10 years after powerful=
 AI is developed:</p><ul role=3D"list"><li><strong>Distribution of health i=
nterventions</strong>. The area where I am perhaps most optimistic is distr=
ibuting health interventions throughout the world. Diseases have actually b=
een eradicated by top-down campaigns: smallpox was <a href=3D"https://www.w=
ho.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/history-of-smallpox-vacci=
nation" target=3D"_blank">fully eliminated</a> in the 1970=E2=80=99s, and p=
olio and guinea worm are nearly eradicated with less than 100 cases per yea=
r. <a href=3D"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Disease_Modeling"=
 target=3D"_blank">Mathematically sophisticated epidemiological modeling</a=
> plays an active role in disease eradication campaigns, and it seems very =
likely that there is room for smarter-than-human AI systems to do a better =
job of it than humans are. The logistics of distribution can probably also =
be greatly optimized. One thing I learned as an early donor to <a href=3D"h=
ttps://www.givewell.org/" target=3D"_blank">GiveWell</a> is that some healt=
h charities are way more effective than others; the hope is that AI-acceler=
ated efforts would be more effective still. Additionally, some biological a=
dvances actually make the logistics of distribution much easier: for exampl=
e, malaria has been difficult to eradicate because it requires treatment ea=
ch time the disease is contracted; a vaccine that only needs to be administ=
ered once makes the logistics much simpler (and such vaccines for malaria <=
a href=3D"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria_vaccine" target=3D"_blank">=
are in fact currently being developed</a>). Even simpler distribution mecha=
nisms are possible: some diseases could in principle be eradicated by targe=
ting their animal carriers, for example releasing mosquitoes infected with =
a bacterium that <a href=3D"https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/south-america=
n-cities-release-mosquitoes-stem-disease" target=3D"_blank">blocks their ab=
ility</a> to carry a disease (who then infect all the other mosquitos) or s=
imply using <a href=3D"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-021-00386-0" =
target=3D"_blank">gene drives</a> to wipe out the mosquitos. This requires =
one or a few centralized actions, rather than a coordinated campaign that m=
ust individually treat millions. Overall, I think 5-10 years is a reasonabl=
e timeline for a good fraction (maybe 50%) of AI-driven health benefits to =
propagate to even the poorest countries in the world. A good goal might be =
for the developing world 5-10 years after powerful AI to at least be substa=
ntially healthier than the developed world is today, even if it continues t=
o lag behind the developed world. Accomplishing this will of course require=
 a huge effort in global health, philanthropy, political advocacy, and many=
 other efforts, which both AI developers and policymakers should help with.=
</li><li><strong>Economic growth</strong>. Can the developing world quickly=
 catch up to the developed world, not just in health, but across the board =
economically? There is some precedent for this: in the final decades of the=
 20th century, <a href=3D"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Asian_Tigers" =
target=3D"_blank">several East Asian economies</a> achieved sustained ~10% =
annual real GDP growth rates, allowing them to catch up with the developed =
world. Human economic planners made the decisions that led to this success,=
 not by directly controlling entire economies but by pulling a few key leve=
rs (such as an industrial policy of export-led growth, and resisting the te=
mptation to rely on natural resource wealth); it=E2=80=99s plausible that =
=E2=80=9CAI finance ministers and central bankers=E2=80=9D could replicate =
or exceed this 10% accomplishment. An important question is how to get deve=
loping world governments to adopt them while respecting the principle of se=
lf-determination=E2=80=94some may be enthusiastic about it, but others are =
likely to be skeptical. On the optimistic side, many of the health interven=
tions in the previous bullet point are likely to organically increase econo=
mic growth: eradicating AIDS/malaria/parasitic worms would have a transform=
ative effect on productivity, not to mention the economic benefits that som=
e of the neuroscience interventions (such as improved mood and focus) would=
 have in developed and developing world alike. Finally, non-health AI-accel=
erated technology (such as energy technology, transport drones, improved bu=
ilding materials, better logistics and distribution, and so on) may simply =
permeate the world naturally; for example, even cell phones quickly permeat=
ed sub-Saharan Africa via market mechanisms, without needing philanthropic =
efforts. On the more negative side, while AI and automation have many poten=
tial benefits, they also pose challenges for economic development, particul=
arly for countries that haven't yet industrialized. Finding ways to ensure =
these countries can still develop and improve their economies in an age of =
increasing automation is an important challenge for economists and policyma=
kers to address. Overall, a dream scenario=E2=80=94perhaps a goal to aim fo=
r=E2=80=94would be 20% annual GDP growth rate in the developing world, with=
 10% each coming from AI-enabled economic decisions and the natural spread =
of AI-accelerated technologies, including but not limited to health. If ach=
ieved, this would bring sub-Saharan Africa to the current per-capita GDP of=
 China in 5-10 years, while raising much of the rest of the developing worl=
d to levels higher than the current US GDP. Again, this is a dream scenario=
, not what happens by default: it=E2=80=99s something all of us must work t=
ogether to make more likely.</li><li><strong>Food security</strong><sup id=

ch=E2=80=9D. I am more optimistic about within-country inequality especiall=
y in the developed world, for two reasons. First, markets function better i=

cost of high-value technologies over time<sup id=3D"fnref:25"><a href=3D"ht=

Section 5.</li><li><strong>The opt-out problem</strong>. One concern in bot=
h developed and developing world alike is people <em>opting out</em> of AI-=
enabled benefits (similar to the anti-vaccine movement, or Luddite movement=

example, the people who are least able to make good decisions opt out of th=

o an ever-increasing gap and even creating a dystopian underclass (some res=

 topic I discuss further in the next section). This would, once again, plac=
e a moral blemish on AI=E2=80=99s positive advances. This is a difficult pr=
oblem to solve as I don=E2=80=99t think it is ethically okay to coerce peop=
le, but we can at least try to increase people=E2=80=99s scientific underst=
anding=E2=80=94and perhaps AI itself can help us with this. One hopeful sig=
n is that historically anti-technology movements have been more bark than b=
ite: railing against modern technology is popular, but most people adopt it=
 in the end, at least when it=E2=80=99s a matter of individual choice. Indi=

 hopeful, though not confident, that AI can also enable unprecedented econo=

s. A truly mature and successful implementation of AI has the potential to =
<em>reduce</em> bias and be fairer for everyone.</p><p>For centuries, legal=
 systems have faced the dilemma that the law aims to be impartial, but is i=

to make the law fully mechanical hasn=E2=80=99t worked because the real wor=

y judgements in a repeatable and mechanical way.</p><p>I am not suggesting =
that we literally replace judges with AI systems, but the combination of im=
partiality with the ability to understand and process messy, real world sit=

 Such AI tools could also be used to monitor for violations of fundamental =
rights in a judicial or police context, making constitutions more self-enfo=

 and drive consensus among citizens, resolving conflict, finding common gro=
und, and seeking compromise. Some early ideas in this direction have been u=
ndertaken by the <a href=3D"https://compdemocracy.org/" target=3D"_blank">c=

.</p><p>I think this question is more difficult than the others. I don=E2=
=80=99t mean that I am necessarily more pessimistic about it than I am abou=
t the other questions (although I do see challenges). I mean that it is fuz=
zier and harder to predict in advance, because it relates to macroscopic qu=
estions about how society is organized that tend to resolve themselves only=
 over time and in a decentralized manner. For example, historical hunter-ga=
therer societies might have imagined that life is meaningless without hunti=

magined that our well-fed technological society is devoid of purpose. They =
might also have not understood how our economy can provide for everyone, or=
 what function people can usefully service in a mechanized society.</p><p>N=
evertheless, it=E2=80=99s worth saying at least a few words, while keeping =
in mind that the brevity of this section is not at all to be taken as a sig=
n that I don=E2=80=99t take these issues seriously=E2=80=94on the contrary,=
 it is a sign of a lack of clear answers.</p><p>On the question of meaning,=
 I think it is very likely a mistake to believe that tasks you undertake ar=
e meaningless simply because an AI could do them better. Most people are no=
t the best in the world at anything, and it doesn=E2=80=99t seem to bother =
them particularly much. Of course today they can still contribute through c=
omparative advantage, and may derive meaning from the economic value they p=
roduce, but people also greatly enjoy activities that produce no economic v=
alue. I spend plenty of time playing video games, swimming, walking around =
outside, and talking to friends, all of which generates zero economic value=
. I might spend a day trying to get better at a video game, or faster at bi=
king up a mountain, and it doesn=E2=80=99t really matter to me that someone=
 somewhere is much better at those things. In any case I think meaning come=
s mostly from human relationships and connection, not from economic labor. =
People do want a sense of accomplishment, even a sense of competition, and =
in a post-AI world it will be perfectly possible to spend years attempting =
some very difficult task with a complex strategy, similar to what people do=

 the other 10% will cause humans to become highly leveraged, increasing com=

 continues to apply. One area humans are likely to maintain a relative (or =

, I think that the human economy may continue to make sense even a little p=
ast the point where we reach =E2=80=9Ca country of geniuses in a datacenter=
=E2=80=9D.</p><p>However, I do think in the long run AI will become so broa=

r current economic setup will no longer make sense, and there will be a nee=
d for a broader societal conversation about how the economy should be organ=
ized.</p><p>While that might sound crazy, the fact is that civilization has=
 successfully navigated major economic shifts in the past: from hunter-gath=
ering to farming, farming to feudalism, and feudalism to industrialism. I s=
uspect that some new and stranger thing will be needed, and that it=E2=80=

 as simple as a large universal basic income for everyone, although I suspe=

since the overall economic pie will be gigantic) to humans based on some se=

will continue to be economically valuable after all, in some way not antici=
